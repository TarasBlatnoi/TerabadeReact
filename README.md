# Terabade React

## Description
Terabade React is our pet project, a React-based rewrite of a previous website built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website is a simple e-commerce platform where users can register, add products to their favorites or cart, and leave reviews on products. We've also added some new functionalities. You can view the hosted version of the website [here](https://terabade-dfdc3e3cb126.herokuapp.com/).

Please note that this is an ongoing project, so it's not fully complete yet. For the backend, we've used Express.js and Passport.js for authentication, with MySQL as the database, hosted on AWS. Currently, only the "Men" category has images and fully populated data.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and responsive design that provides a seamless shopping experience across all devices.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Powerful search functionality with filters for price, category, type, and more to help customers find products quickly.
- **Shopping Cart and Wishlist**: A convenient shopping cart with the ability to save items to a wishlist for future purchases.
- **User Accounts**: Customers can create accounts to manage their orders, track shipping, and securely store payment information.
- **Product Reviews**: Allows customers to leave reviews on products, enhancing trust and providing feedback to others.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent shopping experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
